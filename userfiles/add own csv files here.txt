In this directory, manually add Files that are used during the generation process.
The sample files here are ignored, but can be used as a copy or base to start with.
Each word should be on his own row (so don't comma seperate it)
Adding files here, will not be overwritten during updating this extension.

There are 5 types of files that can be manually added here:

- personal_artists_xyz.csv
Add any number of files formed as personal_artists_xyz.csv. These will show up in the artists selection.
For example, you can create a personal_artists_portrait.csv and a personal_artists_favorites.csv. Both will then show up as options.

- styles_ti_lora.csv
Fill this one with style textual inversions and LoRA's. They will then randomly be used in prompt generation. See sample file.

- listname_addon.csv
Addon files will be automatically added to the existing csv files in the ./csvfiles/ directory. So you can add your own personal stuff. They need to be named the same, such as vehicles_addon.csv

- listname_replace.csv
Replace files will automatically replace the existing csv files in the ./csvfiles/ directory during prompt generation. This way, you can run of your own custom lists if you need. They need to be named the same, such as vehicles_replace.csv

- custom_input_prefix.csv, custom_input_mid.csv and custom_input_suffix.csv
Add anything in these files, and they will show up in the front of the prompt, in the middle, or at the end. This adds some additional flexiblity, if you want certain specific results. They will be randomly used in the prompt generation.

- antilist.csv
Any value in this csv file will be removed from any list/csv file used during prompt generation.
For example, if you don't want "film grain" to show up, add this to the antilist.csv
It should look like this:
film grain
purple
cat

- custom_subjects.csv
Values to be attached to -subjectfromfile- wildcard. This wildcard can be used in the subject override field, and it will pick the subjects randomly from this file.


Happy prompting!
