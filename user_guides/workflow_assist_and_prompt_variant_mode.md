# Working with the workflow assist tab

This tab has been inspired by Woisek. The main purpose is working and refining on a prompt.

The prompt generation process here, does work with all the settings from the Main tab.

On the Workflow assist tab, it has 3 distinct parts.
- Workflow prompt field and turning on workflow mode
- Creating a prompt variant with the Prompt variant slider
- Generating a set of prompts with a button

The workflow is often the following:

- Generating random prompts until you find something you think you like
- Moving it up the the workflow prompt
- Iterate on the workflow prompt

## Generating some random prompts
On the Workflow assist page, you can scroll down and press __"Generate me some prompts!"__ .

This will now generate 5 prompts. You can keep pressing the button to get new prompts.

Use the button, __"Send prompt up"__, to send this prompt to the workflow prompt field.

Here are some results:

## Using the workflow prompt mode
If you want to use the workflow prompt, turn on __Workflow mode__. This way the normal generation process of One Button Prompt is turned off, and it will now use whatever is in the prompt field.

#### Using wildcards in the workflow prompt
The workflow prompt can process One Button Prompt wildcards. Please refer to [wildcards documentation](https://github.com/AIrjen/OneButtonPrompt/blob/docs_and_small_updates/user_guides/wildcards_and_dynamic_prompts_extension.md)

## Using the prompt variant slider
The prompt variant slider creates variants of the workflow prompt.

#### How it works
It creates a small rift in subspace near your Central Processing Unit. Through this rift, it connects to various alternative universes where you are doing the exact same thing at the exact same time. It then flows their prompt to yours (and the other way around). This way, we get a slightly alternative prompt since it was from a slightly alternative universe. The prompt variant slider determines how many alternate universes away it should take the prompt from.

#### An example
To give an example, I first take a prompt from CivitAI, to prove it can work on anything. As usual, it's a long prompt, and it gives a good result. Lets try it out!

In this test, I am keeping the seed to 1, and the samplers etc all the same.

Here is the result:

Now, lets increase the prompt variance, and let it run. In this case I've set the variance to 5. Again, the bigger the number, the more varied the prompt.

Results from variants with variance level 5:

And just for the fun of it, here is what happens if you put it at level 10. You can see almost nothing resembling the original prompt. But still good results.
