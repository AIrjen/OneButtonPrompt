# Special prompt generation modes

Currently in One Button Prompt there are 9 different prompt generation modes. There is the stanard mode, but additional modes have been added in.

Hopefully, they can be used to inspire you even more. Maybe you will even use a favorite one.

## Standard
The default of One Button Prompt, and is used in most occasions to generate the prompt for you. While random, it is also very structured in the build of the prompt.

In order to spice things up, there have been additional prompt generation modes added. Those generation modes are more random, and favor certain keywords above others.

These modes will randomly show up, and are controlled by the "One in X chance to use special image type mode" slider.  So lower means more often. When set to 1, it will always pick a random special generation mode. When set to 20, it is a 1 in 20 chance this will happen.

These modes can also directly be selected from the "type of image" dropdown.

## only templates mode
This mode is even more special.

Has a set of template prompts from various sources, fully wildcarded and usable with Subject Override. This has it's own user guide, which can be found here:  [guide to prompt templates](https://github.com/AIrjen/OneButtonPrompt/blob/main/user_guides/templates.md)

## art blaster mode
Special generation mode that focusses on art movements, stylings and artists.

As you can see in the example prompts, there is a favor in adding artists and art movements. This mode is best used with models that can handle those artists.

Example prompts:

## subject only mode

Will only generate a subject, with no additional frills. The subjects will still be complicated, with the normal One Button Prompt logic for creating a subject. Note that all the specials surrounding the subject are still in!

Best used for models with strong artstyles build in. For the examples in this one I used revAnimated model

Example prompts:
