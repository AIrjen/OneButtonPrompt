# One Button Prompt

# Summary

One Button Prompt is a tool/script for automatic1111 for beginners who have problems writing a good prompt, or advanced users who want to get inspired.

It generates an entire prompt from scratch. It is random, but controlled. You simply load up the script and press generate, and let it surprise you.

It is best used on all-purpose models, such as Stable Difussion 1.5 or those based on 1.5. Such as [deliberate](https://civitai.com/models/4823/deliberate) and [dreamlike diffusion](https://civitai.com/models/1274/dreamlike-diffusion-10). However, feel free to use it on your personal favorite models.

## How to use in automatic1111
In TXT2IMG or IMG2IMG, select the script "One Button Prompt".

Leave the prompts empty:

Enjoy creating awesome pictures:

> Concept art, Fluid Biosphere, at Dawn, F/1.8, Kodak portra, extremely beautiful ,

Please be aware, that not each picture will be awesome due to the randomness of the prompt, artist and model used.
You might get an epic landscape, or a photo of an Aggregavated Trout. In my experience, about 1 in 5 is good. Everyone of them is interesting.

Some more examples below.

### Some details
It will generate between 0 and 3 artists, and add those the prompt.

It can generate the following subjects, while building a prompt:

1. object - Can be a random object, a building or a vehicle.  

2. animal - A random (fictional) animal. Has a chance to have human characteristics, such as clothing added.  

3. humanoid - A random humanoid, males, females, fantasy types, fictional and non-fictional characters. Can add clothing, features and a bunch of other things.  

4. landscape - A landscape or a landscape with a building.  

5. concept - Can be a concept, such as "the X of Y", or an historical event such as "The Trojan War".  

It mixes techniques such as prompt switching and hybrids. 

This generator will generate a complete full prompt for you, based on randomness. You can increase the slider, to include more things to put into the prompt. 
Recommended is keeping it around 3-7. Use 10 at your own risk.

There are a lot of special things build in, based on various research. Just try it, and let it surprise you.

Suggestion is to leave the prompt field empty, anything here will be added at the end of the generated prompt.  
It doesn't add anything to the negative prompt field, so feel free to add your favorite negative prompts here.  

For each Batch you run, it will create a new prompt. For each batch size, it will reuse the same prompt.


# Installing in automatic1111
It can be used in automatic1111. Simply install this from via install from URL. After that you can see OneButtonPrompt in the script fields for txt2img and img2img.
Set the following URL to install from: https://github.com/AIrjen/OneButtonPrompt

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/130234949/230917712-60a3c1f4-fea6-4ecd-bc68-da52f1ff86fe.png" alt="Easy to install" width="50%" height="50%">

You can also download the files from github directly, and place them under your automatic1111 installation in the \Extensions\ folder.

# Main tab

Guide your prompt here. You can increase the slider, to include more things to put into the prompt. Recommended is keeping it around 3-7. Use 10 at your own risk. I usually run it between 5 and 7.

You an use the Subject Types filter to select on main subject types to generate. Maybe you want only Landscapes, maybe you want only people. Select it here.

Artists have a major impact on the result. Automatically, it will select between 0-3 artists out of 3483 artists for your prompt.
You can turn it off. Add your own artists to the prompt, and they will be added to the end of the prompt.

Type of image can be used to force a certian direction. For example when using Realistic Vision, it might be a good idea to set it to photograph. For an anime model, you might want to use "Anime key visual"

If you write anything in the prompt field, it will be added to the generated prompt. You can select where it goes, in the front or at the back. Users have been using this to add their own LoRA's or textual inversions. You can also add your own artists here if wou'd like, or anything else you want to have control over.

# Workflow assist tab
I've added a Workflow assist tab in a recent update.

This tab is designed to help with the workflow of adjusting and maintaining prompts without turning the extension off.
"Workflow mode" turns off the generated script, and uses the Workflow prompt instead.

This part is still being developed, to have a better UI.

It also has the options to generate a few prompts with a click and send them to the workflow prompt. This way you can search or combine interesting ideas together.

# Advanced / prompt compounder
On the advanced tab, there is the option to compound multiple generated prompts together. It is set to 1 for normal behavior, a single prompt. You can up this, for interesting results.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/130234949/233619883-17f58277-d536-4682-bb69-7c86d4a0b1bd.png)

There is however, some tricks build into this, for use with the [Latent Couple](https://github.com/opparco/stable-diffusion-webui-two-shot) extension. Using setting the seperator to "automatic AND" and the Prompt compounder equal to the amount of latent spaces, you can combine interesting things together.

Example here with 3 different landscapes combined together in a single image.

If you want more control, use "current prompt + AND". An example would be "Art by brandon woelfel, 2 people" and setting the subject type to humanoids. This will automatically form the prompt for use with latent couple:

# off-hands, automatic generation
This project started out as a personal project, to automatically generate windows wallpapers. The code is still in here, and can be used. You would need to set it up correctly, so it is for advanced users only.

In the main.py script, there is logic that calls the API's from automatic1111. Uncomment the lines you need, such as txt2img. You also need to create some folders on your computer (see code)
Start automatic1111 with the option --api and run the main script.
Edit the main script to set the amount of loops/images to generate, and uncomment the txt2img, img2img and upscale scripts to taste.

It was build for personal development, so adjust directories and settings accordingly.

# roadmap
Some ideas I'd like to implement:
- Better workflow management in workflow assist tab
- Curated artist lists
- SD 2.1 support (inversion negative prompt)
- Ongoing: list refinements and new features in the prompt generation

If you have a good idea or suggestion, let me know, or build it yourself ;)
