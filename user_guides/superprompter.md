# SuperPrompt Integration
Superprompt is a prompt model that has been integrated into One Button Prompt. It is One Button Prompts take on this model, and is not a standalone implementation.

What is does, is generate longer, more readable prompts, while still being attached the One Button Prompt framework. It passes the generated subject of One Button Prompt into Superprompt, but it keeps all the other stylings generated in the process.

It also uses insanitylevel as expected. Lenght and variety increased per level. From level 9 and 10, prompts can get really crazy and spout nonsense. As it should.

If you just want to play with SuperPrompt, you can set the imagetype to __"subject only mode"__. This way, it will not add any stylings from One Button Prompt.

In this example, created with the D&D Portrait preset, you can see the bolded part being generated by Superprompt instead based of a subject determined by One Button Prompt.

## FAQ

#### Help, sometimes it takes very long to get a prompt back, it looks stuck
When using a subject and/or outfit override, it will repeat the prompt generation up to 10 times until it gets all the words that were given. This results in more consistent output, but it can take a while for it to finish some times. Please be patient.
