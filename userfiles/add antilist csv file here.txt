In this directory, manually add a file called antilist.csv
Any value in this csv file will be removed from any list/csv file used during prompt generation.
For example, if you don't want "film grain" to show up, add this to the antilist.csv
Each word should be on his own row (so don't comma seperate it)
It should look like this:
film grain
purple
cat


Happy prompting!
