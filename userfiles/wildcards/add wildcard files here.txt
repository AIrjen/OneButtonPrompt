Add wildcard files here, if you can't make use of Dynamic Prompts.
Files can be called as "sample_wildcard.csv" and are then usable in One Button Prompt with -sample_wildcard- as the wildcard.
.txt files are also supported here.

It is not possible to call build-in wildcards from the custom wildcards.
It is possible to nest custom wildcards with other custom wildcards (up to 10 deep). To do this, use the -wildcard- notation inside a wildcard.
