# My first generation
Here are some example methods and tips on how to receive some good results.

Maybe it can give you some ideas and inspiration on how to use this tool. You can just leave everything on "all", which is the most fun!

It works best with models that are more general and multi purpose. Such as [deliberate](https://civitai.com/models/4823/deliberate) and [dreamlike diffusion](https://civitai.com/models/1274/dreamlike-diffusion-10). However, feel free to use it on your personal favorite models.

## Portraits

In this example, I am using the deliberate model.
I've set the Sampling method to "DPM++ SDE Karras", Sampling steps to "25" and lowered the CFG Scale to "6"
You can increase the batch count, to keep creating new images.

Then I scroll down and activate the One Button prompt script.

I set the complexity of the prompt to 5, which is a nice middle ground for prompts.

As a "Subject Type" I select "humanoid", this will ensure I will get a human, or humanoid like result from the prompt.

For "Artists" I select "popular". This is a list of popular artists from images from CivitAI. Such as LOIS, Artgerm, alphonse mucha and many others.

As "Type of image" I select "portrait", so that it will always default to a portrait image.

At that point, you can just press generate.

Some other tips:
- You can switch "Type of image" to "digital art"
- You can switch "artists" to "Portrait" or "Character"

## Photos
In this example, I am using the [Realistic Vision](https://civitai.com/models/4201/realistic-vision-v20) model.

I've set the Sampling method to "DPM++ SDE Karras", Sampling steps to "25" and kept the CFG Scale to "7"
You can increase the batch count, to keep creating new images.

I set the complexity of the prompt to 5, which is a nice middle ground for prompts. For photo's you might want to go a bit lower.

As a "Subject Type" I select "humanoid", as the Realistic Vision model likes to generate humans.

For "Artists" I select "photograph". This is a list of photography artists. However "fashion" is also a good option here. I can also recommend "none", so no artist is generated at all
When using Photograph artists, there is a very high chance of getting a portrait image.

As "Type of image" I select "photograph", so that it will always default to a portrait image.
